### 1. How do I approach designing software?
####  -What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
####  -What design process did you follow for your project work?
####  -How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I tend to approach designing software by breaking down the full picture into smaller, more approachable tasks. For example, in the beginning we had to select an image and break it down into basic shapes. While I did aleady have this approach for writing programs, I somehow didn't correlate that this workd for visual aspects as well beforehand. In this case, when recreating the image of the fountain, I worked my way from the bottom towards the top. This allowed me to (literally) build on top of my last task, and gave me the ability to get as close to the shape of the original picture as possible.
  
### 2. How do I approach developing programs?
####  -What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
####  -How did iteration factor into your development?
####  -How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

While developing my 3D scene, I was reminded that small changes can make a meaningful impact, whether for the better or worse. It's much easier to see small changes when they are visually represented rather than written out as code. During this project, I factored iteration by building each shape on top of the previous to build the fountain. Once I felt the shape was in the correct point and at a proper size, I would move on to the next one. Some minimal changes would be done on previous shapes from time to time, but this method allowed me to stay organized by only working on the shape that needed immediate attention. Had I attempted to draw the entire image before running my code, It may have become a difficult task to fix, since the spacing and sizes would most likely have been incorrect.
   
### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
####  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
####  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

At the beginning of this course, we were given the base code, which had all of the specifications for shapes and also had texture images. It was difficult in the beginning as I was not familiar with any of the previously defined functions, how they worked, and how to create my projects and assignments within it. This course has helped me better understand how to work with and research more extensive code that was created by another party. While it did slow me down in the beginning, it was ultimately a helpful took which helped prevent repetitive and redundant code. Professionally, There will rarely be an opportunity to create a program from scratch, especially early on. This was a great learning opportunity in both how to take the time to better understand someone else's work, and reminded me of the importance of using proper indentation and commenting to allow other's to understand my work in the future.
